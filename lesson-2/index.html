  <h1>Willie Mangram </h1>


  <p>Born in Spain and raised in Florida, I have just moved to San Diego after living in Florida almost my entire life. The past two years I have worked as a Helpdesk Support Specialist and a Junior Network Administrator. I found my passion in developing while working in those two roles and began my journey from that point on.
    My first website I created and released on a web server is this website you're currently visiting! This project was a pleasure and a pain to work on, but I hope that the passion poured into it is reflected in my work as well as the projects that are and will be included.
    What I realized when I first began working in IT is that I will never stop learning, whether it be a new language, framework, programming paradigm, or programming workflow. There will always be something new for me to learn and although that may sound intimidating at first, it means that I'll one day have a wealth of knowledge in which I can pass on and help other new/passionate developers get where they want to be.</p>
